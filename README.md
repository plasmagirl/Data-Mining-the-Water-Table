# Pump it up - Predicting the functionality of water pumps in Tanzania.

This project is a part of the [DrivenData competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/). Our goal is to predict the functionality of the water pumps based on data provided. A smart understanding of which pumps will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean water is available to communities across Tanzania. This data was provided by [Taarifa](http://taarifa.org) and Tanzanian Ministry of Water. The water pumps fall under one of the three classes - 

- `functional`: pump is operational and no repairs needed 
- `functional needs repair` pump is operational but needs repairs, and
- `non-functional`. pump is non-operational

Our aim is to predict the operating condition for each pump in the `test` file with a high classification rate.
